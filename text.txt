Despite the forecast, live like it's spring.
Each day comes bearing its gifts. Untie the ribbon.
Sometimes the most important thing in a whole day is the rest we take between two deep breaths.
Be a bush if you can't be a tree. If you can't be a highway, just be a trail. If you can't be a sun, be a star. For it isn't by size that you win or fail. Be the best of whatever you are.
